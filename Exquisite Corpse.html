        <h3> Motivation</h3>
         <p>  Since I got two woman's picture from my partners, I tried to describe both the elegance and strongness that women have. Here is the background story: A rabbit is dressing up. It's her first time to try an elegant skirt, climing up stairs to become an adult. She keeps wearing her favorite cat T-shirt. When we clicked the screen, cats appear on the screen, which describes her confidence that she looks good in her favorite T-shirt. </p>
         <h3>Reflection</h3>
         <p>I felt I was getting comfortble in using p5js but I also think there is a big room for improvement in terms of the efficiency of my code. 
            Use defined function was useful to organize my code and repeately draw same or similar shapes. </p>
