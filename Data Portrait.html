        <h3> Motivation</h3>
        <p>I reflected on my online communication and visualized how many people per day I chat online. I got data for a week.</p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>It was interesting to know I chat with large number of people from Friday to Sunday compared to weekdays. Also, I thought I talked with more people online but it turned out the number is smaller than I expected. I gained the clearer understanding of myself by visualizing data. I don't think I lost anything since the data is simple enough and I didn't feel I had to omit any part of the data I collected. </p>
