        <h3> Motivation</h3>
        <p> I always remember Tatsuo Miyajima, a Japanese artist, who create lots of counters of number that counts up from 0 to 9 in a different speed. His artwork, from distance, looks like bunch of lights flickering like insects. Also, the counters are often placed on the water. I tried to capture the image of lights flickering on the water. I described the water with pink arcs and yellow arcs that appear when mouse is clicked. I took an abstract approach for the counter since it looks better with the abstraction. </p>
        <h3> Reflection</h3>
        <p> It turend out to be what I expected, especially, I liked the organic movement of the ellipses. I decided to fix the place of each elliplise this time since the counters of my inspiration artwork do not move. In the future, I would love to work on effects to move objects so it looks like a generative art.    </p>
