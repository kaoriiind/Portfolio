        <h3> Motivation</h3>
         <p> I tried to draw "rilakkuma," a Japanese popular bear character as a practice to draw what I exactly wanted to draw. Firstly, I drew normal emoji like human faces during sketches as a basic start. However, after leaning about functions in the class, I changed my mind and decided to draw a bear since it has more components that I can play with. 
            I didn't like the flickering the random function gives to the drawing so just used random function to the coloring at first. After completing all the process, I added random function to the size a bit to reduce the intentional elements.
            I used ratio to my variables to keep the basic shape of face to prevent the face to be distorted to the extent that it won't look like a face such as eyes are bigger than the face itself, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>At first, I didn't like random function very much because of my biased image of it. I thought random fnction distorts everything and audience can't even figure what the original drawing is. However, I realized random function can add interesting features, roughly keeping the original shape, by carefully choosing the parameters. 

                About the form, I realized a bear still looks like a bear even after the dimentional change of the shape of the face. That means we recognize a bear not by the exact shape of the face but by other elements like the shape of the ears and where each element of the face is located, and so on.</p>
