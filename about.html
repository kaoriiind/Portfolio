    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2> Hello! I'm Kaori Ogawa.</h2>
    <h3> I graduated from the University of Tokyo, Japan, studying macroeconomics.</h3>
    <h3> I love chestnut cakes, mout blanc. I have a premium membership of mont blanc cafe in Japan. </h3>
    <h3> I'm still trying to figure out my career goals, but I would like to connect insights derived from artistic/design perspectives to industry. </h3>
    <h3> I didn't have much connections with technology before coming to DT, but I'm currently exposed to variety of technology thanks to talented peers and great classes. </h3>
