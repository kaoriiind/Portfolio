    <h1>Lost and Found</h1>

        <h3> Motivation</h3>
        <p>My partner lost a flashlight with a wind-up handle, so I depicted it. Here is the description I received: It was silver with a black nose(the actual light part had a black rim around it), and had a black
            handle on the side. The handle would close into the flashlight so it all maintained one shape, but
            you could pop it out to wind the flashlight up. The flashlight had a skinny handle that had kind of
            a grip shape on it, and then the light part was wider, but there was a smooth transition between
            the two, so it almost looked like a spoon but if you were to make it into a closed shape. The
            handle was maybe 2‚ÅÑ3 the diameter of the head of the flashlight with the light. The handle was
            like a third of the length of the flashlight with a knob at the end. </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>  The language my partner used to describe the image was precise enough to get the clear image of the flashlight. Especially, quantitative description helped me a lot to draw each part of the flashlight. 
            I interpreted the image as a flashlignt that is small enough to be portable and come in handy in camping or during power outage. My image can be broken down into 4 parts. Body of the flashlight, light part of the flashlight, handle to wind up the flashlight and light itself. For the body, I used a regtangle and roudned corner so it looks cute and friendly. I described the grip by drawing thick lines in parallel. For the light part of the flashlignt, I drew trapezoid and oval. For the oval, I drew black and white oval together using a function called ellipseMode. In the wind up part, I used several rectangles and put them together. Last not but least, I used triangles to describe the light, using blendMode to make the picture dramatic.
            My interpretation didn't change a lot at all stages of the assignment. However, I tried to make a better use of the background color to describe the details such as curves.</p>
