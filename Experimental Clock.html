        <h3> Motivation</h3>
        <p> I was going to my first yoga class in the U.S. right before finishing this assignment so I drew my favorite yoga pose. In addition to yoga, I had 2 other ideas. My design sketches are below.

            Sketch 1: Scenery with the sun (from sunrise to sunset)
            If I close my eyes, time goes more slowly, else, time goes by in normal speed (if/else function and map function)
            Sun moves according to seconds and the color of sky changed accordingly 
            
            Sketch 2: Walk
            If I walk from left to right in the upper half of the canvas, then the footsteps accumulate in the bottom half of the canvas. 
            Background color changes according to seconds
            
            I chose Sketch 3 because I liked how the circle represents my breathing and how the synchronization between my arm movements, breathing, and my internal sense of time is depicted</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>It was valuable learning experience to understad how to create a natural transition from a static image to a dynamic one that changes over time. I think I could make the coding simpler so will try to make it simpler in the next time.</p>
