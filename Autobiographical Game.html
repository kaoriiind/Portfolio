        <h3> Motivation</h3>
         <p>I tried to describe the challenge I faced and my growth after coming to the U.S. as an international student.</p>
         <h3>Reflection</h3>
         <p>Creating a game initially felt overhwelming. I wasn't sure where to begin or how to bring my ideas to life. However, as I progressed, it turned into an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I became more engaged and enthusiastic about the project with each step I took.

            Through this process, I learned how challenging it is to step into the player's hoes, especially when they have no prior knowledge of the game. Crafting clear and comprehensive instructions was harder than I anticipated. Despite my efforts, I sometimes found that my descriptions weren't as clear as they needed to be. This taught me the importance of effective communication and the need to view my work from the player's perspective.
            
            Additionally, it was fascinating to think about the formlas and logic required to achieve the desired outcomes in my game. I discovered multiple ways to code to obtain the same results, which expanded my learning experience. Exploring these different coding methods deepened my understanding of programming concepts.
            
            Overall, creating this game not only enhanced my technical skills but also improved my ability to communicate and think critically from different perspectives. It was a valuable learning journey that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
